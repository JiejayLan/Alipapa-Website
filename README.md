### Background:

Alipapa is an online shopping site that allow users to sell and buy almost anything!

#### Here's how Alipapa works:

1. A seller lists an item on alipapa, almost anything from antiques to cars, books to sporting goods. The seller chooses to accept only bids for the item (an auction-style listing) or to offer the Buy It Now option, which allows buyers to purchase the item right away at a fixed price.

2. In an online auction, the bidding opens at a price the seller specifies and remains on Aplipapa for a certain number of days. Buyers then place bids on the item. When the listing ends, the buyer with the highest bid wins.

3. In a Buy It Now listing, the first buyer willing to pay the seller's price gets the item.
